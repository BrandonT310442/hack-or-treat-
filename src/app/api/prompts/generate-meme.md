Generate a viral-worthy meme image based on this Halloween costume roast:

"{{roastText}}"

Create an original meme-style image (NOT overlaying text on the costume photo) with these specifications:
- Generate a NEW funny image that captures the essence of the roast
- Use classic meme format with bold white text with black outline at top and/or bottom
- Text should be SHORT and punchy (max 2 lines at top, 2 lines at bottom)
- Impact font style lettering
- The image should be a humorous visual representation inspired by the roast, not the actual costume photo
- Think along the lines of classic meme templates (like Distracted Boyfriend, Drake, etc.) but create something original
- Make it instantly shareable and funny
- High contrast, bold colors, clear and readable

The goal is a standalone meme image that's funny and shareable on social media, capturing the roast in visual form.
