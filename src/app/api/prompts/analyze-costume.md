1. Identify what costume they are trying to be (e.g., "Dracula", "Harley Quinn", "Pirate", "Ghost", etc.)
2. List specific failures and problems with the costume such as:
   - Cheap or low-quality props
   - Wrong colors or mismatched pieces
   - Poor fit or sizing issues
   - Missing key elements
   - Dollar store quality materials
   - Any other obvious problems

Be brutally honest like a disappointed theater critic. Focus on SPECIFIC observable details.
